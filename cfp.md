# Call for papers (system description papers)

The shared task of the ArgMining 2022 invites the submission of short papers on system/ approach descriptions to achieve either [subtask A or B](https://phhei.github.io/ArgsValidNovel/). A submission of such a paper requires a [submission of test predictions according to our test production submission procedure](https://phhei.github.io/ArgsValidNovel/submission) beforehand. The deadline is already expired.

## Submission Information

By default, we accept one type of papers: short papers (4 pages + references + appendix (optional)). Accepted papers will be given an additional page to account for the reviewers' comments. All papers will be treated equally in the workshop proceedings. The workshop follows ACL’s policies for submission, review, and citation. Moreover, authors are expected to adhere to the ethical code set out in the ACL Code of Ethics. Submissions that violate any of the policies will be rejected without review.

Please use the COLING 2022 style sheets for formatting your paper: https://coling2022.org/
