# Shared task on predicting validity and novelty of arguments

In recent years, there has been increased interest in understanding how to assess the quality of arguments systematically. [Wachsmuth et al.](https://aclanthology.org/E17-1017) proposed a framework for quality assessment consisting of the following top dimensions: logic, rhetoric, and dialectic. Regarding the dimension of logic, there has been some work to assess the quality of an argument or conclusion automatically.

Recently, there has also been interest in the generation of conclusions or arguments. In order to guide the process of automatically generating a conclusion, our assumption is that we might need metrics that can be automatically computed to estimate the suitability and quality  of a certain conclusion. Two important metrics/objectives are that the conclusion is **valid**, that is, that the conclusion “follows” from the premise. At the same time, it is easy to produce conclusions that “follow” from the premise by repeating (parts of) the premise in the conclusion, trivially generating a “valid” but vacuous conclusion. In this sense, it is important to assess whether conclusions/arguments are not only valid, but also **novel**.

We define **validity** as requiring the existence of logical inferences that link the premise to the conclusion. In contrast, **novelty** requires the presence of novel _premise-related_ content and/or combination of the content in the premises in a way that goes beyond what is stated in the premise. Hence, a conclusion that is valid but not novel could be a repetition, a paraphrase or a summary of the premise, and only a novel conclusion offers a piece of information that extends what is already covered by the premise – whether it supports or contests the premise.

## Tasks

We divide the task of Validity-Novelty-Prediction into two subtasks.

1. Task A: The first task consists of a binary classification task along the dimensions of novelty and validity, classifying a conclusion as being valid/novel or not given a textual premise. 
1. Task B: The second subtask will consist a comparison of two conclusions in terms of validity / novelty 

Participants can choose whether to address Task A or Task B, or both.

### Subtask A: binary novelty-validity-classification

Given a premise and a conclusion in natural language, the task is to predict:

1. whether the given conclusion is valid with respect to the premise
1. whether the given conclusion is novel with respect to the premise

Hence, we expect two binary decisions as output.

#### Example: Vegetarianism

Premise: The notion of man's dominion over animals need not be thought of as a blank check for man to exploit animals. Indeed, it may be appropriate to connect the notion of "dominion" to stewardship" over animals. Yet, humans can be good stewards of animals while continuing to eat them. It is merely necessary that humans maintain balance, order, and sustainability in the animal kingdom. But, again, this does not require the abandonment of meat-eating.

| **Conclusion** | **Validity** | **Novelty** |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Two-party systems are more stable | no | no |
| Man's "dominion" over animals does not imply abandoning meat. | yes | no |
| The idea of "domiminism" is unnecessary. | no | yes |
| Dominion over animals can and should be used responsibly | yes | yes |

#### Datasets & Evaluation

Please read the [Data Description](https://phhei.github.io/ArgsValidNovel/data-description) beforehand.

> If you use the data, please cite our [overview paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.argmining-1.7/).

- Train: [here](https://github.com/phhei/ArgsValidNovel/blob/gh-pages/TaskA_train.csv)
  - you're allowed to extend the train set with further (synthetic) samples. However, if you do that, you have to describe/ provide the algorithm which extends the training set. This algorithm must be automatically executable without any human interaction (hence, without further manual annotation/ manual user feedback)
- Dev: [here](https://github.com/phhei/ArgsValidNovel/blob/gh-pages/TaskA_dev.csv)
- Test: [without labels](https://github.com/phhei/ArgsValidNovel/blob/gh-pages/TaskA_test-without-labels.csv) => [submit](https://phhei.github.io/ArgsValidNovel/submission)
- (**New**) Test: [with labels](https://github.com/phhei/ArgsValidNovel/blob/gh-pages/TaskA_test.csv)

**Evaluation:** we consider the _f1_macro_-score recognizing instances as correctly predicted only if validity and novelty are both correctly predicted.

### Subtask B: recognizing relative validity / novelty

Given a premise and two conclusions A and B in natural language, the task is to predict:

1. whether conclusion A is better than conclusion B in terms of validity 
1. whether conclusion A is better than  conclusion B in terms of novelty

There are three possible labels for this task: better/worse/tie.

#### Example: US offshore oil drilling	

Premise: These large ships release significant pollution into the oceans, and carry some risk of hitting the shore, and causing a spill.

| **Conclusion A** | **Conclusion B** | **Validity** | **Novelty** |
|--------------|--------------|----------|---------|
| Transporting offshore oil to shores by ship has environmental costs. | Need for water does not qualify water as a right. | A > B | A > B |
| Oil drilling releases significant pollutants into the ocean | Transporting offshore oil to shores by ship has environmental costs. | A = B | A < B |

- (**New**) Test: [with labels](https://github.com/phhei/ArgsValidNovel/blob/gh-pages/TaskB_test.csv)

**Evaluation:** We require following format for each instance for each aspect (validity/ novelty).

- -1: A>B: Conclusion A is more (valid/ novel)
- 0: A=B: Conclusion A and B are equally valid/ novel
- 1: A<B: Conclusion B is more  (valid/ novel)

We consider the average of the _f1_macro_-score for validity and novelty.
